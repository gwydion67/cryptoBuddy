# cryptoBuddy
Sperax Internship Full Stack Project

## Objective:
Develop a single-page application (SPA) named, where users can:<br>
    1. Add tokens to their watch list.<br>
    2. View their current balance for each token.<br>
    3. View the historical balance of each token based on date.<br>
    4. Check their token allowance.<br>
    5. Perform operations on the token, ex: transfer to another address, approve token.<br>
Requirements:<br>
1. Wallet Connection:<br>
    ○ Users should be able to connect their own Metamask or any other wallet.<br>
    ○ Alternatively, users should be able to provide a wallet address as an input.<br>
2. Watch List:<br>
    ○ Users can add various tokens to their watch list.<br>
    ○ Display the current balance of each token in the watch list.<br>
3. Historical Data:<br><br>
    ○ Fetch and display the historical balance of each token.<br><br>
    ○ Provide a date picker for users to select the date range.<br>
4. Allowance:<br>
○ Users should be able to check their token allowance for different smart contracts.<br>
5. Token Transfer:<br>
○ Implement a functionality that allows users to transfer tokens to another address.<br>
○ Include form fields for the recipient address and amount to be transferred.<br>
6. Visual Representations:<br>
○ Use tables, charts, and graphs to represent token balances, historical data, and<br>
allowances.<br>
○ Be as creative as possible with the visual representation of data.<br>
<br>
The project is developed using Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Express, Ether.js, etc.<br>
<br>
To start the project, clone the repository and run the commands in the client and  server directory, for frontend and backend respectively.<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gwydion67/cryptoBuddy.git
```
The frontend is hosted on localhost:5173 and backed on localhost:3000.

The database used is mongodb, you will need to put the mongodb url in the .env file, use the .env.example as a template.

Thank you.<br>
